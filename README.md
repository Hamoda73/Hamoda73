About Me

Introduction

I am a second-year computer science engineering student with a user-focused approach and a passion for innovation and continuous improvement.

Education

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in computer science engineering and am in my second year of studies in Ecole Superieure PRivée d'Ingenierie et de Technologies école d'ingenieurs.

Projects

During my studies, I have worked on several projects that have helped me develop my skills in software engineering. Some notable projects include:

2D Game Project with External Controller using Arduino: This project involved creating a 2D game using SDL in C++, and an external controller using an Arduino. This project taught me about game programming and embedded systems.

Web Project with Centralized Database: I worked on a web project that used JavaScript, PHP, HTML, and CSS, and had a centralized database using phpMyAdmin. This project taught me about web development and database management.

Smart RDI Center Desktop Application using Qt Dev and MySQL Database: This desktop application was built for employees at a smart RDI center, and used Qt Dev and MySQL database. Additionally, an Arduino was used for some external functions. This project taught me about desktop application development and hardware integration.
